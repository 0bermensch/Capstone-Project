For my capstone project in BrainStation I created a music app that caters to the user's real-time emotion. I have customized several playlists for specific emotions.

In this project I used React for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for back-end. I also used the Microsoft Azure Face Detection API and Spotify API.
